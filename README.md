Repairs broken Windows Movie Maker project files (wlmp) if you've moved associated movie clips and images

You can download my utility here (it is not signed so Windows will show scary warning messages. Click "More Info" then "Run Anyway"): https://github.com/dxzl/windows-movie-maker-utility/releases

You can still download Windows Movie Maker here:

This project builds with the free version of Embarcadero RAD Studio C++ Builder 10.2 (Tokyo) or higher.

First drag-drop your Windows Movie Maker project file, then drag-drop the root folder where your source movie clips and images are stored. Apply the changes and save the new file.

Use Tools->Copy project and media files to new folder to relocate/consolidate a working Windows Movie Maker project.

Use at your own risk (the usual...)
