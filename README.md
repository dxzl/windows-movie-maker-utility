The Problem: Windows Live Movie Maker project files use absolute file-paths. That means that after you make a movie, you can't change the location of the media files in your movie. This app solves that problem!

You can download my utility here (it is not signed so Windows might show scary warning messages. Click "More Info" then "Run Anyway"): https://github.com/dxzl/windows-movie-maker-utility/releases

If Windows 11 won't run my utility, try this: Windows Key+S to bring up "Search". Search for "Reputation-based protection". Scroll down to "Potentially unwanted app blocking" and try turning that off.

You can still download Windows Live Movie Maker here:

For Windows 11, you need to run Windows Live Movie Maker in compatibility mode for Windows 7. In File Explorer go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Live\Photo Gallery. Right click on MovieMaker.exe and choose Propertues. In the Compatibility tab choose "Run In Campatibility Mode" and choose "Windows 7".

This project builds with the free version of Embarcadero RAD Studio C++ Builder 10.2 (Tokyo) or higher: https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter/free-download
